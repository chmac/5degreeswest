Follow the minor road up the side of Loch Striven past Ardyne Point to reach Inverchaolin farm.  Take the track past the farm which soon peters out to a faint line which can be followed on the SE side of Inverchaolin Glen to reach the Bealach na Sreine.  A forest bars the way ahead but can be skirted N for about 1 km. to pick up a track just beyond its northern edge which leads initially SE then N down through the forest to the B836.
